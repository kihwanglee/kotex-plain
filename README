Usage
-----

To typeset Hangul, start your document as follows:

    \input kotexplain

You should use `etex` or `pdftex` commands to compile the document
since kotex-plain uses e-TeX primitives. Also keep in mind that 
Korean documents needs to be encoded in UTF-8.

To specify Hangul fonts, you can use the following methods:

* `\hfont{outbb}{at 12pt}`: This command set the current Hangul font
as 12 point bold.  This is the most general way of specifying
Hangul fonts.
* `\hfontname{outbtb}`: This is equivallent to `\hfont{outbb}{}`, which
only applies bold typeface to the current font.
* `\hfontsize{at 12pt}`: This command changes the size of the current
font as 12 point. Same effect can be achieved by `\hfont{}{at 12pt}`.

To use CWEB system for literate programming, you can use `hangulcweb.tex`
as follows:

    \input hangulcweb
